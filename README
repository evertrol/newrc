newrc
=====

Python netrc alternative with some extended capability


Based on the standard library netrc module.

The default behaviour is the same as the netrc module, and using

    import newrc as netrc

should work fine


Extras
------

- Allow for multiple entries of the same host / machine. Optionally
  select for a specific user, using the `authenticators2()` method.

- Allow for POSIX-style parsing, with the `posix=True` argument to
  `netrc()`. This allows whitespace in string by quoting them.

  When using this option, values such as password containing comment
  characters (default: #), single and double quotes should be quoted
  or escaped. For example:

      'password with whitespace'
	  '###'
	  'double"quote'
	  'shell style '\'' single quote escaping'
